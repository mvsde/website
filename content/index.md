## About me

My full name is _{{ author.fullName }}_ <small>({{ author.fullNameIPA }})</small>, but please call me just _{{ author.name }}_ <small>({{ author.nameIPA }})</small>. I’m non-binary and go by _they/them_ pronouns. I created a handy [pronouns guide](pronouns/en.md) with examples if you’re unsure how to use them. I live in the metropolitan area of Hamburg, which some claim to be the most beautiful city in Germany.

I practice [Shinson Hapkido](http://www.shinsonhapkido.org){lang=de hreflang=de} martial arts in our small Dojang in Buchholz. As an active member of the cyclists clubs [ADFC](https://www.adfc.de/){lang=de hreflang=de} and [Buchholz fährt Rad](https://buchholz-faehrt-rad.de/){lang=de hreflang=de}, I lobby for the mobility transition.

When something [Star Wars](https://twitter.fynn.be/1408409600643190788/) or [Star Trek](blog/2024-05-30-farewell-star-trek-discovery.md) is published, I _will_ consume it. What I don’t consume are all the [video games I obsessively collect](https://steamcommunity.com/id/mvsde/). There are also [photos of sunsets](sunset.md) which I collect as well, for reasons.

I work as a senior frontend developer with a focus on web accessibility at [Factorial](https://www.factorial.io/). Occasionally, I also tinker with a handful of [open source projects](https://github.com/mvsde).
