## About me

My full name is _Fynn Becker_, but please call me just _Fynn_. My gender is non-binary, and I go by _they/them_ pronouns. I created a handy [pronouns guide](pronouns/en.md) with examples if you’re unsure how to use them. I live in the metropolitan area of Hamburg, Germany.

At [Factorial](https://www.factorial.io/), I work as a senior frontend developer with a focus on web accessibility. Occasionally, I also work on a handful of [open source projects](https://github.com/mvsde).

I practice [Shinson Hapkido](http://www.shinsonhapkido.org){lang=de hreflang=de} martial arts in our small Dojang in Buchholz. As an active member of the cyclists clubs [ADFC](https://www.adfc.de/){lang=de hreflang=de} and [Buchholz fährt Rad](https://buchholz-faehrt-rad.de/){lang=de hreflang=de}, I lobby for the mobility transition.

When something [Star Wars](https://twitter.fynn.be/1408409600643190788/) or [Star Trek](/blog/farewell-star-trek-discovery/) is published, I _will_ consume it. What I don’t consume are all the [video games I obsessively collected](https://steamcommunity.com/id/mvsde/). There are also [photos of sunsets](sunset.md), which I collect too.
