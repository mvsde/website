    Photo at dusk: the landscape is already quite dark, a harvested field stretches to the horizon. A few dark trees are visible against the sky.
    There is still some blue in the sky, but most of it is covered by heavy clouds.
    Towards the left, a smaller cloud hangs in front of the sun, creating long godrays that streak to the right.
