    The sky is covered with dark storm clouds, a bit of sunset red is peaking through the clouds here and there.
    A single contrail emerges from a cloud and streaks through the sky almost like a big laser cannon that just fired.
    Underneath the sky is a sliver of dark landscape, slightly hilly with a few tree silhouettes at the horizon.
