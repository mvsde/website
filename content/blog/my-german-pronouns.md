You may remember me complaining about the [missing neutral pronoun in German](../missing-neutral-pronoun-german/). Well, unfortunately it’s still missing, and I don’t want to wait for an “official” one any longer. So, I finally decided on a neo-pronoun:

<span lang=de translate=no>**dey/denen**</span> (equivalent to the English singular <span lang=en translate=no>_they/them_</span>).

For those familiar with German, this pronoun isn’t that neo after all. Only <span lang=de translate=no>_dey_</span> is an actually “invented” word. This is necessary because there is nothing comparable to the English singular <span lang=en translate=no>_they_</span>. The other grammatical cases already exist in the language.

|             | Nominative                            | Possessive                              | Dative                                  | Accusative                            |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Pronoun** | <span lang=de translate=no>dey</span> | <span lang=de translate=no>deren</span> | <span lang=de translate=no>denen</span> | <span lang=de translate=no>dey</span> |

You can learn more about how I like to be addressed on [Pronouns.page](https://pronouns.page/@mvsde). And if you think this is way too complicated: I also have a name (Fynn) that you can always use instead of pronouns. Though you already pick correct pronouns for every _binary_ person out there. It would be great if you could also use correct pronouns for _non-binary_ people like me.
