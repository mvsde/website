You may remember me complaining about the [missing neutral pronoun in German](../missing-neutral-pronoun-german/). Well, unfortunately it’s still missing, and I don’t want to wait for an “official” one any longer. So, I finally decided on a neo-pronoun:

{% lang "de", "**dey/denen**" %} (equivalent to the English singular _they/them_).

For those familiar with German, this pronoun isn’t that neo after all. Only {% lang "de", "_dey_" %} is an actually “invented” word. This is necessary because there is nothing comparable to the English singular _they_. The other grammatical cases already exist in the language.

|             | Nominative             | Possessive               | Dative                   | Accusative             |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Pronoun** | {% lang "de", "dey" %} | {% lang "de", "deren" %} | {% lang "de", "denen" %} | {% lang "de", "dey" %} |

You can learn more about how I like to be addressed on [Pronouns.page](https://pronouns.page/@mvsde). And if you think this is way too complicated: I also have a name (Fynn) that you can always use instead of pronouns. Though you already pick correct pronouns for every _binary_ person out there. It would be great if you could also use correct pronouns for _non-binary_ people like me.

## Usage examples

### Nominative

> {% lang "de", "**Dey** ist Frontend-Entwickler*in." %}  
> <small>Translation: **They** are a frontend developer.</small>

### Possessive

> {% lang "de", "fynn.be ist **deren** Website." %}  
> <small>Translation: fynn.be is **their** website.</small>

### Dative

> {% lang "de", "Ich bin **denen** kürzlich begegnet." %}  
> <small>Translation: I’ve met **them** recently.</small>

### Accusative

> {% lang "de", "Ich habe **dey** auf Twitter gefunden." %}  
> <small>Translation: I’ve found **them** on Twitter.</small>
