You may remember me complaining about the [missing neutral pronoun in German](2021-07-11-missing-neutral-pronoun-german.md). Well, unfortunately it’s still missing, and I don’t want to wait for an “official” one any longer. So, I finally decided on a neo-pronoun:

**dey/denen**{lang=de translate=no} (equivalent to the English singular _they/them_{lang=en translate=no}).

For those familiar with German, this pronoun isn’t that neo after all. Only _dey_{lang=de translate=no} is an actually “invented” word. This is necessary because there is nothing comparable to the English singular _they_{lang=en translate=no}. The other grammatical cases already exist in the language.

|             | Nominative                  | Possessive                    | Dative                        | Accusative                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Pronoun** | [dey]{lang=de translate=no} | [deren]{lang=de translate=no} | [denen]{lang=de translate=no} | [dey]{lang=de translate=no} |

You can learn more about how I like to be addressed on my [pronouns overview page](../pronouns.md). And if you think this is way too complicated: I also have a name ({{ author.name }}) that you can always use instead of pronouns. Though you already pick correct pronouns for every _binary_ person out there. It would be great if you could also use correct pronouns for _non-binary_ people like me.

## Usage examples

### Nominative

> [**Dey** ist Frontend-Entwickler*in.]{lang=de translate=no}\
> <small>Translation: **They** are a frontend developer.</small>

### Possessive

> [fynn.be ist **deren** Website.]{lang=de translate=no}\
> <small>Translation: fynn.be is **their** website.</small>

### Dative

> [Ich bin **denen** kürzlich begegnet.]{lang=de translate=no}\
> <small>Translation: I’ve met **them** recently.</small>

### Accusative

> [Ich habe **dey** auf Mastodon entdeckt.]{lang=de translate=no}\
> <small>Translation: I’ve found **them** on Mastodon.</small>
