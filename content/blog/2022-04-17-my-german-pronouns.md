::: Note
I no longer use _dey/denen_{lang=de translate=no} in German. Head on over to the blog post [revisiting my German pronouns](2025-07-05-revisiting-my-german-pronouns.md) for the latest update.
:::

I prefer the English pronouns _they/them_{lang=en translate=no} to also be used in German. But read on if you don’t feel comfortable using English words in German sentences.

You may remember me complaining about the [missing neutral pronoun in German](2021-07-11-missing-neutral-pronoun-german.md). Well, unfortunately it’s still missing, and I don’t want to wait for an “official” one any longer. So, I finally decided on a neo-pronoun:

**dey/denen**{lang=de translate=no} (equivalent to the English singular _they/them_{lang=en translate=no}).

For those familiar with German, this pronoun isn’t that neo after all. Only _dey_{lang=de translate=no} is an actually “invented” word. This is necessary because there is nothing comparable to the English singular _they_{lang=en translate=no}. The other grammatical cases already exist in the language.

|                    | Nominative                   | Possessive                           | Dative                        | Accusative                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **English/German** | [they]{lang=en translate=no} | [their/theirs]{lang=en translate=no} | [them]{lang=en translate=no}  |                             |
| **German**         | [dey]{lang=de translate=no}  | [deren]{lang=de translate=no}        | [denen]{lang=de translate=no} | [dey]{lang=de translate=no} |

You can learn more about how I like to be addressed on my [pronouns overview page](../pronouns.md). And if you think this is way too complicated: I also have a name ({{ author.name }}) that you can always use instead of pronouns. Though you already pick correct pronouns for every _binary_ person out there. It would be great if you could also use correct pronouns for _non-binary_ people like me.

## Usage examples

> [**Dey** ist Frontend-Entwickler*in.]{lang=de translate=no}\
