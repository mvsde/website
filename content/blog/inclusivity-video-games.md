Video games and software development share an unfortunate “feature”: Both are dominated by white western men. But recently some progress could be made on either front. Developers share their experiences with gatekeeping and racism, and more video games tell inclusive stories with diverse characters.

Do not get me wrong: This is just the beginning. For each small success, a huge pile of rottenness waits to be poked. This I learned while [expressing my dismay for John Bain’s views on GamerGate](https://twitter.com/mvsde/status/1331893390666035201). Apparently daring to speak his name immediately [summons the GamerGate apologists](https://twitter.com/mvsde/status/1332281128070344704).

As important as it is to unearth the bad, sometimes we should also praise the achievements along the way.

Contrary to widespread belief [I am not a big time gamer](/games). Yes, I do own an enormous amount of video games. However, I rarely ever play them because I am mentally not able to. Thank you, dear game developer who implements a _super-duper easy mode_, I am grateful for that! That aside, over the years a handful of games crossed my path that feature an inclusive story and gameplay mechanics.

## The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim

At first glance, _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_ does not present itself as particularly focused on inclusivity. However, one of the core strengths of open world and role-playing games is their openness: The player can create a character to their liking and more or less do whatever they want. In case of Skyrim [same-sex and interracial marriage](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Marriage_(Skyrim)) is possible. For a game released in 2011 this can be considered quite progressive.

## Tomb Raider

One of the most well-known video game series got a fantastic reboot in 2013. The first two installments, _Tomb Raider_ and _Rise of the Tomb Raider_, were written by Rhianna Pratchett. The games feature the lead character _Lara Croft_. When _Tomb Raider_ was first released in 1996, the notion of a female protagonist was revolutionary, and not something the publisher accepted without a fight.

Today female characters and especially protagonists are a lot more common in games. But some publishers are still under the impression, that “women don’t sell.” Most recently voiced by the [wretched management of Ubisoft](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-21/ubisoft-sexual-misconduct-scandal-harassment-sexism-and-abuse). The Ubisoft “management men” are truly a disgusting lot.

## The Last of Us

_The Last of Us Part I_ but especially _Part II_ tell deep stories. PTSD and loss of loved ones lead to a never-ending spiral of blinding revenge. Not only do the characters commit unforgivable acts, but the player is also forced to go with them and learn all sides of the story. Eye-opening indeed.

Homosexuality has become a widely accepted orientation, which is interesting since _The Last of Us_ is set in a contemporary timeline. The transgender character _Lev_ played by Ian Alexander is a welcome addition. Go watch season 3 of _Star Trek: Discovery_ for the fantastic character _Gray Tal_, also played by Ian.

## Life is Strange

The _Life is Strange_ series (Life is Strange, Life is Strange: Before the Storm, and Life is Strange 2) tackle a wide variety of topics. Amongst them are physical and mental abuse, suicide, homosexuality, immigration, and racism. While the games use magic systems as a mechanic, the stories itself are grounded in reality and relatable for teenagers and adults alike.

This game let me experience what racism in the US feels like. It is gut-wrenching. The interactive nature of games conveys feelings in a way, books or movies cannot. Good games make the player a part of the story. The _Life is Strange_ games achieve this with powerful stories.

## Tell Me Why

A game whose story is all about being transgender: coming out, transitioning, and living as a transgender person. The story of _Tell Me Why_, by the same developer as the _Life is Strange_ series, feels natural despite (or precisely because?) it covers a very complicated but important and relevant topic.
