I recently observed a [new trend in progressive German](https://twitter.com/mvsde/status/1551278470017204227), new to me at least, which means it’s “dissecting gender in the German language time” again. Today we take a look at the German word <span lang=de translate=no>_man_</span>, not to be confused with the English <span lang=en translate=no>_man_</span>. Although they seem similar and share the same origin, they have different meanings:

<span lang=de translate=no>man</span> (German)
: one, you, they (indefinite pronoun)

<span lang=en translate=no>man</span> (English)
: an adult male human

## Examples

Take this random English sentence I just came up with:

> <span lang=en translate=no>**One** does not simply walk into Mordor.</span>

It translates to Duden[^1]-approved German like this:

> <span lang=de translate=no>**Man** spaziert nicht einfach nach Mordor.</span>

This is a very common pronoun used for general statements in German.

## Etymology

The history of the modern German <span lang=de translate=no>_man_</span> can be traced back all the way to the common ancestor of most European languages, Proto-Indo-European:

* Proto-Indo-European: <span lang=ine translate=no>_*mon-_, _*men-_</span>
  * Proto-Germanic: <span lang=gem translate=no>_*mann-_</span>
    * Proto-West Germanic: <span lang=gmw translate=no>_*mann_</span>
      * Old High German: <span lang=goh translate=no>_man_</span>
        * Middle High German: <span lang=gmh translate=no>_man_</span>
          * German: <span lang=de translate=no>_Mann_, _man_</span>

And there we have it: <span lang=de translate=no>_man_</span> and <span lang=de translate=no>_Mann_</span> (translates to the English <span lang=en translate=no>_man_</span>) are basically the same word, they are even pronounced the same way. Head over to [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/mann-) which is an absolute treasure if you want to learn more about Etymology aka the history of words.

## The problem

Despite being an indefinite pronoun, <span lang=de translate=no>_man_</span> is strongly associated with <span lang=de translate=no>_Mann_</span> which carries a “male” undertone. It’s really hard to shed this connotation when the word is essentially the same minus one letter.

Which leads us back to the above-mentioned trend and the question: How can we turn German into a more inclusive language?

The word <span lang=de translate=no>_man_</span> could be replaced with more specific pronouns like <span lang=de translate=no>_ich_</span> (English <span lang=en translate=no>_I_</span>) or <span lang=de translate=no>_wir_</span> (English <span lang=en translate=no>_we_</span>). This loses some of the original meaning though since the use of an _indefinite_ pronoun is generally intentional.

Another approach would be – you guessed it – passive voice. But turning everything into passive voice on our quest for a gender-neutral language inevitably leads to a very unnatural sounding, kinda technical way of speaking and writing.

## A solution

Language is what we the people speak and write, not what a random _Council for German Orthography_ or _Association for the German Language_ deem “correct” German. As long as others understand what we say (i.e., the language actually works as a means of communication), we can do whatever we want.

Why search for weird alternatives if we could turn to English once again and just use the literal translation of <span lang=en translate=no>_one_</span> (as in the translation for the numeral).

Meet the new indefinite German pronoun <span lang=de translate=no>**eins**</span>.

It is a direct replacement for <span lang=de translate=no>_man_</span>, so it doesn’t even require that much rethinking:

> <span lang=de translate=no>**Eins** spaziert nicht einfach nach Mordor.</span>

[^1]: The _Duden_ is the most well-known German dictionary. The actual “standards body” for German is the _Council for German Orthography_. While the _Duden_ is becoming increasingly progressive, the _Council_ is [staffed by a bunch of boomers](https://www.rechtschreibrat.com/ueber-den-rat/), so, we can safely ignore it.
