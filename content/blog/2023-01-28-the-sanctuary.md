I’ve written quite a lot about my _queer journey_, but the spark that started it all is still missing on this blog. So, let’s get into that, it involves one of my favorite things: _Star Trek!_

4 December 2020.

Star Trek: Discovery Season 3 Episode 8 “The Sanctuary” is airing in Germany.

In that episode a key moment between _Adira Tal_ and _Paul Stamets_ takes place in which Adira comes out to Stamets as a non-binary person:

> Um, ‘they’, not–not ‘she’. I've never felt like a ‘she’ or–or a ‘her’, so I would prefer ‘they’ or ‘them’ from now on.
>
> — Adira Tal played by Blu del Barrio

The moment is so wonderfully heartfelt, and I literally started crying tears of joy because for the first time _ever_ I’ve seen myself represented in media. Adira has the same quirky, nerdy, and introverted energy as me. Them coming out as a non-binary person triggered something in me and I started questioning my gender for real. I always felt there was something off, but I couldn’t put my finger on it until that moment.

I didn’t switch to _they/them_ pronouns overnight, though. It took another three quarters of a year or so for me to let go of the “he”. In that time, I discovered a lot more non-binary people, especially in the developer community on Twitter. Yet another reason why I always liked Twitter despite the obvious chaos that platform ~~is~~ was.
