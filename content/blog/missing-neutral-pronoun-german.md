In October of 2020, I wrote a blog post about [the gender problem with the German language](../german-language-and-gender/). In short, every German noun has either one or multiple genders (_feminine_, _masculine_, or _neuter_) attached to it. This is in itself not problematic, unfortunately nouns that describe what a person _is_ are almost always in the _generic masculine form_.

_Teacher_, _cyclist_, or _astronaut_ – these English words don’t have any gender, but the German translation is always masculine first:

> {% lang "de" %}Lehrer, Radfahrer oder Astronaut{% endlang %}

The German feminine form must be explicitly derived from the masculine one:

> {% lang "de" %}Lehrer**in**, Radfahrer**in** oder Astronaut**in**{% endlang %}

Thankfully, a lot of progress has been made over the last couple of years. Namely the combination of the masculine and feminine form into a new neutral one:

> {% lang "de" %}Lehrer<strong>:</strong>in, Radfahrer<strong>:</strong>in oder Astronaut<strong>:</strong>in{% endlang %}

Instead of a colon, the “gender star” ( * ) and “gender gap” ( _ ) also see widespread usage. But apart from their not-so-aesthetic looks inside a word, the colon comes with better support for assistive technology. Both star and underscore will be read out loud by screen readers, the colon inserts a short pause.

This is a perfect segue to the _glottal stop_, which is a short pause inside or at the end of a spoken word. In English the glottal stop is most often heard when words or syllables end in plosives like _t_ or _k_:

> ligh<u>t</u>, apar<u>t</u>ment, no<u>t</u>ebook, ba<u>ck</u>seat

Inserting short pauses slowly becomes more common in spoken German for the “neutralized” nouns to match the written form:

> {% lang "de" %}Lehrer{% endlang %} <small>(short pause)</small> {% lang "de" %}in{% endlang %}

Colons and glottal stops inside nouns are a huge win on German’s path to becoming an inclusive language. But. There is one elephant in the room.

## Singular they

The German language lacks a neutral pronoun. The binary pronouns _she_ and _he_ have direct translations, but there is no equivalent for _singular they_. Yes, the _plural they_ has a translation, but it cannot easily be used in a singular way. The reason is a terribly overloaded word:

| Type             | English | German                               |
|------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| Singular pronoun | she     | {% lang "de" %}sie{% endlang %}      |
| Plural pronoun   | they    | {% lang "de" %}sie{% endlang %}      |
| Formal address   | you     | {% lang "de" %}Sie{% endlang %}      |
| Female being     | a she   | {% lang "de" %}eine Sie{% endlang %} |

There is a lot of debate and some new pronouns have been proposed. Nothing stuck and nothing is official. The best stop-gap solution is avoiding pronouns completely. Instead of “Dear Ms Adira Tal”, an email or letter can begin with “Hello Adira Tal” to respect the pronoun preference “they”. See how I snuck in [some Star Trek lore](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Adira_Tal) 😏?

The highest court of the state of Hesse confirmed that [a binary greeting “Ms” or “Mr” invades the personal rights](https://ordentliche-gerichtsbarkeit.hessen.de/pressemitteilungen/obligatorische-angabe-von-%E2%80%9Eherr%E2%80%9C-oder-%E2%80%9Efrau%E2%80%9C-verletzt-person-mit-nicht-bin%C3%A4rer). Forms must provide a third non-binary choice and the “official” gender of a person according to the registered civil status is irrelevant. Everyone may choose whatever address they prefer.

Court decisions like these are great for certain use cases. But sometimes a pronoun is absolutely necessary to construct a grammatically correct sentence. So, a neutral pronoun is still missing.
