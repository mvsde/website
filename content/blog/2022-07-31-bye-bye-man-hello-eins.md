I recently observed a [new trend in progressive German](https://twitter.fynn.be/1551278470017204227/), new to me at least, which means it’s “dissecting gender in the German language time” again. Today we take a look at the German word _man_{lang=de translate=no}, not to be confused with the English _man_{lang=en translate=no}. Although they seem similar and share the same origin, they have different meanings:

[man]{lang=de translate=no} (German)
: one, you, they (indefinite pronoun)

[man]{lang=en translate=no} (English)
: an adult male human

## Examples

Take this random English sentence I just came up with:

> **One** does not simply walk into Mordor.
> {lang=en translate=no}

It translates to Duden[^1]-approved German like this:

> **Man** spaziert nicht einfach nach Mordor.
> {lang=de translate=no}

This is a very common pronoun used for general statements in German.

## Etymology

The history of the modern German _man_{lang=de translate=no} can be traced back all the way to the common ancestor of most European languages, Proto-Indo-European:

- Proto-Indo-European: _\*mon-_, _\*men-_{lang=ine translate=no}
  - Proto-Germanic: _\*mann-_{lang=gem translate=no}
    - Proto-West Germanic: _\*mann_{lang=gmw translate=no}
      - Old High German: _man_{lang=goh translate=no}
        - Middle High German: _man_{lang=gmh translate=no}
          - German: _Mann_, _man_{lang=de translate=no}

And there we have it: _man_{lang=de translate=no} and _Mann_{lang=de translate=no} (translates to the English _man_{lang=en translate=no}) are basically the same word, they are even pronounced the same way. Head over to [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/mann-) which is an absolute treasure if you want to learn more about Etymology aka the history of words.

## The problem

Despite being an indefinite pronoun, _man_{lang=de translate=no} is strongly associated with _Mann_{lang=de translate=no} which carries a “male” undertone. It’s really hard to shed this connotation when the word is essentially the same minus one letter.

Which leads us back to the above-mentioned trend and the question: How can we turn German into a more inclusive language?

The word _man_{lang=de translate=no} could be replaced with more specific pronouns like _ich_{lang=de translate=no} (English _I_{lang=en translate=no}) or _wir_{lang=de translate=no} (English _we_{lang=en translate=no}). This loses some of the original meaning though since the use of an _indefinite_ pronoun is generally intentional.

Another approach would be – you guessed it – passive voice. But turning everything into passive voice on our quest for a gender-neutral language inevitably leads to a very unnatural sounding, kinda technical way of speaking and writing.

## A solution

Language is what we the people speak and write, not what a random _Council for German Orthography_ or _Association for the German Language_ deem “correct” German. As long as others understand what we say (the language actually works as a means of communication), we can do whatever we want.

Why search for weird alternatives if we could turn to English once again and just use the literal translation of _one_{lang=en translate=no} (as in the translation for the numeral).

Meet the new indefinite German pronoun **eins**{lang=de translate=no}.

It is a direct replacement for _man_{lang=de translate=no}, so it doesn’t even require that much rethinking:

> **Eins** spaziert nicht einfach nach Mordor.
> {lang=de translate=no}

[^1]: The _Duden_ is the most well-known German dictionary. The actual “standards body” for German is the _Council for German Orthography_. While the _Duden_ is becoming increasingly progressive, the _Council_ is [staffed by a bunch of boomers](https://www.rechtschreibrat.com/ueber-den-rat/), so, we can safely ignore it.
