Germany’s government just broke up after what amounts to years of backstabbing each other. But it has passed one important new law for queer rights: The lovely named _Gesetz über die Selbstbestimmung in Bezug auf den Geschlechtseintrag_{lang=de}. Just rolls of the tongue. Peak German. Let’s shorten it to _SBGG_ from here on.

The SBGG allows anyone to change their legal gender and first names without the need for psychological assessments or medical procedures. Rather progressive indeed. So, I did just that.

Three months ago, I sent my application to the _Standesamt_{lang=de} (civil registry office), because there’s this weird 3-month waiting period in the SBGG. We can’t make things too easy, right? Still dealing with German bureaucracy after all!

Then mid-November 2024, I had an in-person appointment with the _Standesamt_{lang=de} to declare my gender and first names, paid 30 €, and was done 15 minutes later. Could’ve been even faster if the scanner wasn’t broken. But hey, Windows and scanner drivers, I know that pain. A week later, I paid another 22.50 € to get new birth certificates which arrived today. The important paperwork is done. Next up 37.00 € for a new national ID card and that’s that. 90.00 € in total for the whole process.

I’m “certified” non-binary now, or in German legal terms I’m _diverse_, and my new first names are _Fynn Ellie_.

I opted for keeping _Fynn_ because I do like that name, it’s short, not overly masculine, and I own this fantastic domain _fynn.be_. But I also wanted to highlight my non-binary-ness in my name. I landed on _Ellie_ for my second first name (that’s a story for another day).

I don’t have any preference which first name you use, could be just one of them or both. _Fynn_, _Ellie_, or _Fynn Ellie_ are all fine.

A second first name also gives me the opportunity to “phase out” my last name _Becker_ for day-to-day use while still having a unique name. This is really exciting because I seriously dislike my last name and now I can slowly get rid of it.
