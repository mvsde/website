Until recently my pronouns were _they_ or _he_. I kept the _he_ for the sake of convenience and because I’m still afraid of fully coming out to everyone. But the _he_ is starting to feel like baggage from a past self that is no longer me. So, effective immediately, my pronouns are _they/them_.

I have no idea how this will translate to my native language German. As you may be aware, [German is a long way off gender neutrality](../german-language-and-gender/) and [still doesn’t have a neutral pronoun](../missing-neutral-pronoun-german/). While there are ways around the first problem, the missing pronoun is challenging.

But more concerning is the lack of acceptance for gender-neutral language in Germany. Two recent studies show 65 to 75 % of participants reject the usage of gender-neutral language in media outlets. The [study conducted by Infratest dimap](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geschlechtergerechte_Sprache#dimap2021) even shows a decline in acceptance.

The following question has been asked:

> What’s your stance on gender-neutral language in the press, radio, TV, and during public events?

A few examples for gender-neutral language in German were given and the participants answered as follows:

|                   | 2021 | 2020 |
|-------------------|-----:|-----:|
| **Approval**      | 26 % | 35 % |
| **Refusal**       | 65 % | 56 % |
| **Not specified** |  9 % |  9 % |

The second [study by Politbarometer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geschlechtergerechte_Sprache#Politbarometer2021) came to similar conclusions.

This isn’t a very positive outlook for someone like me who struggles with coming out. My entire identity is based on English because my native language has no words for me. I literally can’t write these blog posts in German because the words necessary don’t exist. There are a few [initiatives for “neo pronouns”](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichtbin%C3%A4re_Geschlechtsidentit%C3%A4t#Empfehlungen_im_Deutschen) though, but nothing took hold yet. Let’s hope for a more colorful and diverse future 🏳️‍🌈
