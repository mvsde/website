**7** years, **5** seasons, and **65** episodes later, _Star Trek: Discovery_ is over.

As far as I‚Äôm concerned, an incredibly important show in the _Star Trek_ universe in particular but also for TV in general. But let‚Äôs start at the beginning, or rather the beginning of the end.

## Enterprise

Starting in 2001, 4 seasons of _Star Trek: Enterprise_ were released over the next 5 years, mostly receiving lukewarm reviews. The premise is quite interesting though, following the first _Enterprise_ starship in a pre-Federation galaxy and a not yet technologically advanced Earth compared to what we are used to from other _Star Trek_ installments.

Unfortunately, the show is also firmly a product of its time. Depicting an outdated sense of masculinity and catering for the male gaze. _Enterprise_ has its fun moments but we have to acknowledge the problematic aspects.

In 2005 the show ended and with it a non-stop 20 year run of _Star Trek_ shows and movies, starting in 1986 with _The Voyage Home_ (who doesn‚Äôt love a wild time traveling story?) and a year later _The Next Generation_.

## The Kurtzman era

A modernization of _Star Trek_ was surely needed to appeal to a new and younger audience. Enter Alex Kurtzman, who together with J. J. Abrams created a reboot in 2009, also known as the _Kelvin_ timeline, an alternate universe spin on _The Original Series_ events with a new cast.

The three movies _Star Trek_, _Star Trek Into Darkness_, and _Star Trek Beyond_ turned out quite popular and brought the necessary freshness to the franchise that admittedly had become a bit stale by that time.

Sure, the action-packed stories are a stark departure from the oftentimes slower-paced and static shows from the last century. But say what you want, we owe it to these movies that we got to the next phase.

## Discovery

_Star Trek: Discovery_ is different from any other _Trek_ that came before. The show heavily focuses on character development, growth, and interpersonal relationships. And crucially true on-screen diversity, an unexpected but welcome surprise coming from stuffy Paramount. Maybe Netflix, who co-produced the first 3 seasons, asserted some influence here?

Instead of that one token People of Color character, we got multiple ones and with Sonequa Martin-Green a fantastic lead actor. And this is just the beginning: A gay couple, brilliant non-human characters, Tig Notaro. The list goes on.

In season 3, the _Discovery_ makes a time jump into the far future, leaving behind the _Star Trek_ legacy, giving us new and exciting characters. I already touched on this in my article [The Sanctuary](2023-01-28-the-sanctuary.md), but I want to again express my deep gratitude for introducing a non-binary (Adira Tal) and a trans (Gray Tal) character to the show.

_Discovery_ played a significant role in my own [gender questioning journey](2021-09-25-dropping-the-he.md). I consider this show a milestone in on-screen representation.

## The future

_Star Trek: Discovery_ is over. It‚Äôs sad to see the _Discovery_ crew go, but I‚Äôd rather have a show ending on a high note, than continuing with endless new seasons that drag on without any purpose.

Four other shows aired while _Discovery_ was on: _Picard_ is a fun 3 season blast from the past. _Lower Decks_ is just the coolest. _Prodigy_ hopefully got a few kids into _Trek_ with its _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_-esque animation. And of course we can‚Äôt forget Captain Pike‚Äôs hair in _Strange New Worlds_.

_Lower Decks_ will soon be over, too. The future of _Prodigy_ is uncertain ‚Äì season 2, where are you? Thankfully _Strange New Worlds_ is still going with a strong combination of the ‚Äúadventure of the week‚Äù concept from old _Trek_ shows and overarching story arcs like we‚Äôve seen in _Discovery_ and _Picard_.

Here‚Äôs to many more voyages. To boldly go where no one has gone before! üññ
