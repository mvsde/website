I own this ginormous video game collection I rarely touch, which is commonly known as the [Pile of Shame](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pile%20of%20shame)™. You can follow me on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/mvsde/) or [GOG](https://www.gog.com/u/mvsde), the only two platforms with usable public profile systems.
