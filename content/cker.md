Hey, you’ve found this little not-so-secret Easter egg. I have no idea what to do with this funny URL, so I put this fantastic credits frame from _The Lord of the Rings_ up there. You’ve probably heard of the disgusting Weinsteins. Peter Jackson, always the visionary, placed two giant trolls in the background. That’s some great foresight.
