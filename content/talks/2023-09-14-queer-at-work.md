This is a hypothetical speech I never actually gave. I think it summarizes quite well what’s going on in my head, so I wanted to preserve it here.

## Introduction

I’m a member of the LGBTQIA+ alphabet soup. In other words: I’m queer. To be specific, I’m a non-binary person. I’m neither a woman nor a man.

I don’t really hide this in my “online” life, visibility is important. For me and for others, especially those who might still be closeted.

Though, in my “offline” life I’m not always that upfront about my queerness. Being visibly queer can be dangerous, both emotionally and physically. You never know how the person or group you’re talking to is going to react.

## That one person

Here’s one example from a couple of years ago:

I planned on coming out to someone I’ve known for quite a while. They made one throw-away comment, which they probably didn’t even really think about:

> I don’t like this gender thing. Men should take responsibility for being men.

I wanted to push back but I was too stunned to do anything. Maybe you know this feeling, too.

One cis-hetero-normative comment from someone I thought to be progressive, completely tore down any safe space we might’ve had in this regard.

And that’s “just” a person I could cut ties with if I wanted to. But out there, something far bigger is happening. And I’m struggling to deal with that, to be honest.

## Out there

When queer people ask you to please stop supporting Joanne K. Rowling, a so-called “feminist” who is happily joining forces with the far right, we mean it.

When we call you out for worshiping Elon Musk, a neo-liberal turned fascist conspiracy theorist, we mean that, too.

Rowling, Musk and their kind are continuously legitimated by people who don’t question who they look up to. Sometimes those “fans” even willingly take part in their hero’s hate rampage.

But it’s not only these A tier “celebrities”. All sorts of politicians and influencers are creating an environment designed to push queer people out. Villainize them even.

That’s called _stochastic terrorism_.

_Stochastic terrorism_ is an insidious method. A targeted group is demonized and dehumanized again and again, until violence becomes likely.[^wikipedia:stochastic-terrorism] Hence the _stochastic_ in the name. Once you know the concept, you see it applied everywhere against marginalized groups.

A real-world example: Twitter is owned by someone who proclaims people like me deserve worse than death. Musk infamously hates his trans daughter and can’t shut up about it. Maybe think about getting off Twitter before it’s too late.

## The future

Staying positive is hard at the moment, as you might imagine. But not all hope is lost. Turning to progressive media is a great way to get other perspectives.

Numerous authors, comic artists, screenwriters, actors, musicians, creators – many of them queer themselves – make us visible.

- _Star Trek: Discovery_ is a diversity fest, basically unprecedented in mainstream TV back when the first season aired in 2017.
- _Alice Oseman_ writes wonderful queer stories. I can recommend to checkout _Loveless_ and _Heartstopper_, the latter has also been adapted into a fantastic Netflix show.
- _ND Stevenson_ created _Nimona_, a beautiful queer and trans story – also on Netflix as an animated movie.
- And the newest example: _Starfield_, a sci-fi action RPG video game. In the character creator, instead of choosing between “female” and “male” you select an ungendered “body type”. And independent of that, you set your pronouns. 6 different options for how to present your character’s gender, 4 to 5 more than the average game.

I can play a character in a AAA video game who is actually treated as non-binary and referred to with their correct pronouns. That was a fantastic surprise, especially considering the gaming “community’s” notorious toxic masculinity.

As an avid gamer, I’m happy to see video games – even “mainstream” ones – becoming more and more diverse and giving players the choice to express their sexuality and gender identity. For some, virtual worlds may very well be the _only_ place to do so safely.

## At work

When I started at Factorial, I introduced myself in a team meeting.

In the week prior, I had a long internal debate going on:

> Will I introduce myself with my pronouns, branding myself as “that queer person”?

or

> Will I play the act of a “normal” cis-hetero guy, flying under the radar?

I chose the latter. Why? Because I didn’t know if it was safe to come out as queer.

Thankfully, that changed when half a year later, a then co-worker came out as non-binary and as far as I can tell the reception was positive.

Factorial turned into a safer space for queer people like me. This is something I am truly grateful for.

I’m navigating a world where I have to constantly think about whether I can be me or have to pretend I’m someone else.

But when I visit the office and there’s a rainbow pillow on the couch, I’m delighted. It’s a seemingly small gesture, but enough to make my day.

## Advice

I want to end with some advice, especially for non-queer people.

If you want to create a safe space where queer people feel welcome, you have to show it and do it.

One of the most basic ways to start is with language. I fully acknowledge that it’s also one of the hardest because language is so ingrained in our culture and thinking.

But stick with me, you can start with small steps:

1. Respect people’s pronouns. Mine are they/them, both for English and German. Yes, also for German.
2. Don’t assume gender based on appearance. From my looks, you would certainly clock me as a man. And you may have seen _The Last of Us_ TV show, where the protagonist _Ellie_ is played by _Bella Ramsey_. You would assume the actor to be a woman. We’re both non-binary.
3. Be conscious about gender “defaults” in language. This is mostly not an issue with English, but in German and other gendered languages everything is usually masculine by default. This creates a linguistic in-group and out-group. In this case “in” means men and “out” everyone else.

These are small adjustments to language that are powerful and help us think more critically about societal norms surrounding gender and sexuality. When we build upon that foundation, we quickly get into _third and fourth wave feminism_, by the way. In Germany, this is sometimes referred to as _queer feminism_.

I encourage you to do some research yourselves and also read about _queer theory_. For example, the works by Judith Butler. Their philosophical essays are pivotal for our modern _intersectional_ and _inclusive_ understanding of feminism.

## The end

Ok, wow. That was a lot.

If you have any questions, you can always talk to me. I can of course only offer my limited perspective and I don’t have answers for everything. So, it’s a good idea to seek out the voices of other queer people, too.
