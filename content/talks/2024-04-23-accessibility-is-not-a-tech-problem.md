In order of appearance:

LLM
: Short for [Large Language Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model), the underlying technology for general-purpose generative AI like ChatGPT.

Combobox
: Technical term for a select dropdown in a form.

Disclosure
: Interactive widget that toggles (shows and hides) content, for example a navigation dropdown.

Application menu
: Usually a bar of dropdowns found at the top of applications, not to be confused with a website navigation menu (see _disclosure_).

ARIA
: Short for [Accessible Rich Internet Applications](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/), the underlying technology for connecting web content with assistive technology.
