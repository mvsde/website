## Preamble

I take up a strong stance on ethical behavior in general and ethical web development in particular. The following positions are by no means complete and will be expanded over time.

## Key Principles

* Everyone is equal. There must not be any distinction based on gender, color, language, birth, social origin, or whatever “category” comes to mind.
* Accessibility is obligatory. There is no debate whether something should be accessible or not—it has to be.
* Force is a last resort. Lethal or non-lethal, it does not matter, conflicts have to be solved peacefully.

## Development-specific Principles

* Tracking is invasive and unnecessary. Ask your users what they want!
* No [Dark Patterns](https://www.darkpatterns.org) at all. They harm the user!
