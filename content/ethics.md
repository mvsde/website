## Preamble

I take up a strong stance on ethical behavior in general and ethical web development in particular. The following positions are by no means complete and will be expanded over time.

## Key principles

### Everyone is equal

There must not be any distinction based on gender, color, language, birth, social origin, or whatever “category” comes to mind.

### Accessibility is obligatory

There is no debate whether something should be accessible or not – it has to be.

### Force is an absolute last resort

Lethal or non-lethal, it does not matter, conflicts have to be solved peacefully.

## Development-specific principles

### Pay the maintainers

Open-source software is free to use, but that does not mean it is free to make. Businesses that make money using open-source projects should contribute back – be it financially or by allocating developer time.

### Alternatives to Google Analytics

Please stop feeding tech giants with even more data about literally every person that dares to use a web browser. You can self-host [Matomo](https://matomo.org) or [Umami](https://umami.is), or use privacy-focused analytics providers like [Fathom](https://usefathom.com) or [Plausible](https://plausible.io).

### [Deceptive design](https://www.deceptive.design/) is shady at best

Deceptive design actively harms the user experience and deceives those who are not aware of these patterns. The web is a friendlier place if you are honest with your intentions.

This is also known as “dark patterns” which is [a problematic term](https://adactio.com/journal/18192).

## Open source license

I am in the process of migrating all my Open Source projects to the [Hippocratic License](https://firstdonoharm.dev). This license is based on the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) and the [United Nations Global Compact](https://www.unglobalcompact.org).
