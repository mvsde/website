## Preamble

I take up a strong stance on ethical behavior in general and ethical web development in particular. The following positions are by no means complete and will be expanded over time.

## Key Principles

### Everyone is equal

There must not be any distinction based on gender, color, language, birth, social origin, or whatever “category” comes to mind.

### Accessibility is obligatory

There is no debate whether something should be accessible or not — it has to be.

### Force is an absolute last resort

Lethal or non-lethal, it does not matter, conflicts have to be solved peacefully.

## Development-specific Principles

### Pay the maintainers

Open Source Software is free to use, but that does not mean it is free to make. Businesses that make money using Open Source projects are urged to contribute back — be it financially or by giving back time.

### Tracking is invasive and unnecessary

Since tracking and ad blockers see widespread usage, analytics is useless anyway. They give a false picture of user behavior. If you want to know what users think about your website or product, ask them, poll them. Use a method that is voluntary and not invasive.

And if you yourself block trackers (e.g. by using _Firefox_ or _Safari_, or by installing a browser extension), and still have tracking scripts on your site, you are a wretched hypocrite!

### [Dark Patterns](https://www.darkpatterns.org) are shady tricks

They actively harm the user experience and deceive those who are not aware of dark patterns. The web is a friendlier place if you are honest with your intentions.

## Open Source License

I am in the process of migrating all my Open Source projects to the [Hippocratic License](https://firstdonoharm.dev). This license is based on the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) and the [United Nations Global Compact](https://www.unglobalcompact.org).
